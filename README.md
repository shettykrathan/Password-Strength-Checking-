 ## 🧠 Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength

Welcome to Task 6 of my Cyber Security Internship! In this task, I explored the art and science behind strong passwords 🔒. By testing different types of passwords using an online strength checker, I gained insight into what makes a password secure and how attackers might try to break them. 💥

---

## 📌 Objective  
Understand what makes a password strong and test it using free online password strength tools.

---

## 🛠️ What I Did

- 🧪 Tested 3 different types of passwords.
- ⚙️ Analyzed their strength using [PasswordMonster.com](https://passwordmonster.com).
- 📊 Evaluated results based on complexity, length, and time to crack.
- 🛡️ Researched common attacks like brute force and dictionary attacks.
- ✅ Documented tips and best practices for creating secure passwords.

---

## 🔍 Key Takeaways

- 🔁 Longer passwords with mixed characters are exponentially more secure.
- 📚 Avoid dictionary words and predictable patterns (like "123456").
- 🛑 Refrain from using personal info (like names or birthdates).
- 🔑 Use passphrases or random words with symbols and numbers.
- 🔐 Multi-factor authentication (MFA) and password managers enhance security.
